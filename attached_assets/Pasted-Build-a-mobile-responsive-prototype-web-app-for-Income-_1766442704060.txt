Build a mobile-responsive prototype web app for “Income Verification” for energy efficiency rebates/incentives.

Product goal:
- Admin configures Programs and income limits (by household size).
- Applicants submit an application (household + income + uploads) via a step-by-step flow.
- System computes preliminary eligibility (Eligible / Not eligible / Needs review).
- Reviewers work from an Airtable-like table/grid with filters; selecting a row opens a right-side detail drawer (full-screen on mobile).
- Reviewer can Approve / Deny / Request info. Applicant can upload additional docs via magic link.

Tech requirements:
- Use Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript.
- Styling: Tailwind + shadcn/ui components.
- Forms: React Hook Form + Zod validation.
- Data layer: Prisma + SQLite for MVP.
- Auth:
  - Reviewer/Admin: email + password (simple auth, hashed passwords).
  - Applicant: magic link token (no password). Generate a token on “start application” and store it; applicant returns via /apply/{token}.
- File uploads:
  - Store uploaded files in local filesystem under /uploads (MVP).
  - Save metadata in DB (filename, path, mime, size, uploadedAt).
  - UI should show upload progress and handle multiple files.
- Responsive behavior:
  - At <768px: grid becomes card list; drawer becomes full-screen sheet; sticky bottom action bar for reviewer decisions.
  - Touch targets >=44px and no hover-only controls.

UI/UX direction (Airtable-like):
- Reviewer/Admin has a top bar with Program selector + search + user menu.
- Left nav: Applications, Programs, Limits, Exports (role-based).
- Applications screen:
  - Desktop: table/grid with columns: Status, Applicant, Program, Submitted, Household size, Declared income, Limit, Result.
  - Filter chips: Status, Program, Date range. Sort by Submitted desc default.
  - Clicking a row opens a right-side drawer with tabs: Overview, Documents, Activity.
  - Sticky actions in drawer: Approve, Deny, Request info.
- Applicant experience (TurboTax-like stepper):
  1) Program + address
  2) Household size
  3) Income (MVP: annual gross income single number)
  4) Upload documents
  5) Review & submit
  - Autosave draft after each step.

Business logic (Eligibility Engine):
- Each Program has an IncomeLimit table: householdSize -> limitAmount.
- When submitted:
  - declaredIncomeTotal = applicantAnnualIncome
  - limit = lookup by householdSize; if not found => Needs review
  - result:
    - If declaredIncomeTotal <= limit AND required docs uploaded => Eligible
    - If declaredIncomeTotal > limit => Not eligible
    - If docs missing or limit missing => Needs review
- Store a “ruleVersion” snapshot on the application: program effective date + income limit row used.

Statuses (use these exact values):
- Draft, Submitted, NeedsInfo, Approved, Denied
Also store “systemResult”: Eligible, NotEligible, NeedsReview (separate from reviewer status).

Email (MVP):
- Do not integrate real email. Instead:
  - When generating an applicant magic link or requesting info, show a “Copy link” UI and log the link to console.

Data model (Prisma):
- User: id, email, passwordHash, role (Admin|Reviewer), createdAt
- Program: id, name, regionLabel (string), effectiveStart (date), effectiveEnd (date nullable), createdAt
- IncomeLimit: id, programId, householdSize (int), limitAmount (int cents), versionLabel (string), createdAt
- Application: id, programId, applicantName, applicantEmail, applicantPhone, addressLine1, city, state, zip,
  householdSize (int), annualIncomeCents (int),
  computedLimitCents (int nullable), systemResult (Eligible|NotEligible|NeedsReview),
  status (Draft|Submitted|NeedsInfo|Approved|Denied),
  ruleVersion (string), applicantToken (string unique), submittedAt (date nullable),
  reviewerId (nullable), createdAt, updatedAt
- Document: id, applicationId, filename, path, mimeType, sizeBytes, uploadedAt
- ActivityEvent: id, applicationId, type (Note|System|RequestInfo|StatusChange), message, createdByUserId nullable, createdAt

Routes/pages (Next.js App Router):
Public applicant:
- /start (choose program, enter name/email -> creates Draft Application + token -> redirect /apply/{token})
- /apply/[token] (stepper UI; autosave)
- /status/[token] (shows current status and missing items; allows doc upload if NeedsInfo)
Reviewer/Admin (protected):
- /app/login
- /app/applications (grid + filters + drawer)
- /app/programs (grid + drawer editor)
- /app/programs/[id]/limits (simple grid editor for limits)
- /app/exports (CSV export button)

API routes:
- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/applications/start
- GET /api/applications/by-token/[token]
- PATCH /api/applications/by-token/[token] (autosave fields)
- POST /api/applications/by-token/[token]/upload
- POST /api/applications/by-token/[token]/submit (run eligibility engine)
- GET /api/applications (list w/ filters)
- GET /api/applications/[id] (detail)
- POST /api/applications/[id]/decision (approve/deny/needsinfo + note)
- CRUD /api/programs and /api/programs/[id]/limits
- GET /api/exports/applications.csv (server creates CSV)

Implementation details:
- Use server actions or API routes—either is fine—but keep it consistent.
- Add seed script to create:
  - 1 admin user (admin@example.com / password: admin123) for demo
  - 1 program “Example Rebate Program” with limits for household sizes 1–6
- Include a README with:
  - how to run, seed, login, and where uploads are stored
  - how to demo applicant flow and reviewer flow

Acceptance criteria:
- Applicant can complete stepper on mobile and desktop, upload docs, submit.
- System result + calculation breakdown appears in reviewer drawer “Overview”.
- Reviewer can filter/sort list, open drawer, view docs, add note, request info, approve/deny.
- Applicant can return via token link, see status, upload more docs when NeedsInfo.
- Export produces a valid CSV with key fields.

Build it with clean, minimal, professional UI (no flashy visuals), Airtable-like labels and controls, and fully responsive layouts.
